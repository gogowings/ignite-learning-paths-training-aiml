# Show the Build in Progress

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [setup](../DEMO.md) before attempting to do the demo.

## Automating the Manual Process

Talking Points:

* So with those points in mind, letâ€™s look at the build definition:
* Rather than doing it in Jupyter Notebooks (like last demo), letâ€™s make it just the code

Demo :

* Start in Azure DevOps in the browser and show build
  * Start with the Pipeline
  * Show last build with our change from the start
  * Highlight the job summary
  * look at the log for "Recreate and submit the pipeline"
* Switch to VSCode and show the same code in a pure python file
  * show the imports
  * show the added arguments
  * walk through the remainder and draw parallels to the notebook flow
* Show the YAML build definition in VSCode if you like
* Switch to the ML UI and show the AML Pipeline that ran, drill in and see the tasks that ran and show stats
* Show the new model that got produced

## Example Demo
