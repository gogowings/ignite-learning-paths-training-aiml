# Show the Release Process

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [setup](../DEMO.md) before attempting to do the demo.

## Automating the Manual Process

Talking Points:

* So with those points in mind, letâ€™s look at the build definition:
* Rather than doing it in Jupyter Notebooks (like last demo), letâ€™s make it just the code

Demo :

* Letâ€™s look at the Release:
  * Show the Release Definition
  * Show the extension for Azure DevOps and that it adds a new artifact type you can set CD on
  * Show the important task â€“ deploying to ACI (expand Deployment Options)
  * Explain that if we wanted to (and we should), we can clone that stage, and maybe deploy to AKS or a different location. We can add gates or manual approvals or gradual rollouts.
* Now weâ€™ve deployed, letâ€™s look at the results:
  *Try uploading the same images again and see that the results are different. A little better, but not perfect â€“ maybe we want to do some more training before releasing this into the wild.
